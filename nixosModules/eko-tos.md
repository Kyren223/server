# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using this service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

## 2. Service Description & Eligibility

This is the **official public instance** of Eko, an open-source, donation-supported communication platform, operated at `eko.kyren.codes`. The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/kyren223/eko). These Terms of Service apply specifically to this instance and are also available online at https://eko.kyren.codes/terms-of-service.

It is provided free of charge and operated in good faith by the project maintainers for community use.

This service is **non-commercial**. While voluntary donations may be accepted to support hosting and development, they do not entitle donors to any service guarantees or contractual rights. Donors may receive optional cosmetic recognition (e.g. icons or badges), which has no functional impact on the service.

By accessing our services, you confirm that you’re **at least 13 years old** and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country to accept these terms.

## 3. User Conduct & Termination

You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the service.

You are solely responsible for your actions, behavior, and any content you submit. We may monitor or moderate content at our discretion, but are not obligated to do so. We do not endorse or verify user content, and you agree not to hold us liable for anything you or others post, transmit, or share.

You must not use the service to engage in illegal, harmful, abusive, or otherwise prohibited behavior.

We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the service **at any time, for any reason or no reason**, with or without notice, and without obligation to disclose the reason.

Suspension or termination of your access will not entitle you to any refund or compensation.

## 4. Privacy & Data Collection

Your use of the service is subject to our Privacy Policy.

We do not require or request user-submitted identifiers such as real names or email addresses. However, technical data such as IP addresses and usage information may be logged for abuse prevention and system monitoring purposes. These logs are automatically deleted after approximately 7 to 14 days.

## 5. No Warranty; Use at Your Own Risk

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **"AS IS"** AND **"AS AVAILABLE"**, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR‑FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

We make no guarantees regarding data loss, security, or privacy.
You assume full responsibility for any consequences resulting from your use of the service.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SERVICE OPERATORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANYONE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING THE SERVICE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

## 7. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the service operators and contributors from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from your use of the service or violation of these Terms.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may modify these Terms or discontinue the service at any time, with or without notice. Your continued use of the service after any change constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 9. Contact & Data Requests

To exercise rights under applicable privacy laws (such as access or erasure), or for general questions about the service, contact **eko-app@protonmail.com**.
Include your User ID if applicable. We will make reasonable efforts to respond to verifiable requests within 30 days.

## 10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Israel, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Israel.

Nothing in these Terms limits rights granted by applicable law that cannot be waived by contract.

## 11. Independent Instances

This service is the official public instance of Eko, operated by Kyren223 at `eko.kyren.codes`. Other independently operated instances may exist but are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible to us.

These Terms apply exclusively to the official public instance. Reuse of these Terms by other instances is discouraged, as doing so may result in inaccurate representations or legal confusion. You should create your own terms.

## 12. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, so these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

## 13. No Waiver

Failure to enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
